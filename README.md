# Personal Finance 2.0

## Introduction

Welcome to Personal Finance 2.0, an easy-to-use command-line Python script designed to help you analyze your expense data over time. This project leverages the power of pandas for data analysis, providing quick and efficient statistical insights into your spending habits. This is an enhanced version of my initial project, now optimized for better performance.

## Requirements & Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Notion**: This free note-taking and task management app will be used to record your daily expenses. Download and install Notion from [here](https://notion.so).
2. **Template**: Use the modular Notion template I created for expense tracking. Duplicate it into your workspace by clicking [this link](https://gelatinous-quince-abe.notion.site/Expenses-Tracking-TEMPLATE-10ce997e127780cba639f4f06e97e6d8?pvs=4) and clicking on the duplicate icon.

### Recording and Exporting Expenses

1. **Record Expenses**: Use the Notion template to log your daily expenses over time.
2. **Export Data**: Once you have accumulated enough data, export it as a CSV file:
   - Open the expenses database in Notion.
   - Click the three dots in the top-right corner.
   - Select **Export** and choose **Markdown & CSV**.
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file and locate the CSV file (rename it for simplicity, e.g., `expenses.csv`).
   - Move the CSV file to the directory containing the project files (`main.py`, `expenses.py`, etc.).

### Installation

1. **Install Python Modules**: Open a command line application (e.g., Windows PowerShell, Git Bash) and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to install the required Python modules:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
## How to Run

1. **Open the Project**: Use any IDE (e.g., VS Code) to open the project folder, ensuring the CSV expenses data file is inside.
2. **Run the Script**:
   - Option 1: In your IDE, open `main.py` and run it.
   - Option 2: Use a command line application to navigate to the project folder and run the script manually:

     ```sh
     python main.py
     ```
