# Personal_Finance
A personal financing program that uses openpyxl (a Python module) to report on data provided in an Excel file particularly extracted from a notion database created to track daily expenses.

### Introduction:
While this project has an about me page that we'll explore later, I'll gladly run you through the purpose and details of this project briefly
1. This application is meant to be a very basic command based program that helps you calculate statistical parameters about your expenses easily and quickly.
2. The expense dataset used is an excel file, the steps to setup your expense tracking system and how to export data will be explained further in this readme.
3. This is my first solo project ever, and I'm open to learning how to optimize and take this project to the next level, as well as some praise for maybe not doing a horrible job? ;)
  4. The program is created using Python, specifically using a library called [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io), which helps extract and modify data in excel workbooks.
